The Jaccard distance is more suited for comparing membership in sets of objects
than Euclidian distance and the Pearson coeffcient. Those measurements are more
suited for comparing discrete numerical values.

Similarly, the Tanimoto index is useful for comparing fixed-length, binary
attributes between items than for comparing tuples of numerical data or
variable sized sets.
